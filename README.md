# Edge2Virus
## What is this program for?
This program is change Microsoft Edge shortcuts in the start menu to a 'virus'
## Why are you making this?
At my school, the IT are pushing everyone to Edge instead of Chrome and sadly it is working. But I am one of the few who they can't trick. Now if my device goes to IT and they try to open Edge, they will find that they opened a program that will slow down whatever they were doing, they will inevitably open Chrome because Edge is a virus
## Will I still be able to open Edge?
Yes, but why would you want to do that? But if you must use Edge go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application and open msedge.exe
